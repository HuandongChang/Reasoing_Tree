        "answer": "If Dana can skip at half the speed she can run, then she can run at 3*2=<<3*2=6>>6 miles per hour.\nAnd since she can run at a speed that is 4 times faster than she can walk, this means she can walk at 6/4=1.5 miles per hour.\nIf two-thirds of the time is spent walking, then she walks for 6*(2/3)=<<6*(2/3)=4>>4 hours.\nIf one-third of the time is spent running, then she runs for 6-4=<<6-4=2>>2 hours.\nThus, she runs for 2 hours at 6 miles per hour, or 2*6=<<2*6=12>>12 miles.\nShe walks for 4 hours at 1.5 miles per hour, or 4*1.5=<<4*1.5=6>>6 miles.\nThus, altogether, she travels 12+6=<<12+6=18>>18 miles.\n#### 18"

        "answer": "His dad will be 24 x 2 = <<24*2=48>>48 years old when Emil is 24.\nHis brother will be 24 / 2 = <<24/2=12>>12 years old then.\nEmil will turn 24 in 24 - 19 = <<24-19=5>>5 years.\nThe age of his father now is 48 - 5= <<48-5=43>>43.\nHis brother is 12 - 5 = <<12-5=7>>7 years old right now.\nThe sum of his dad's and his brother's ages now is 43 + 7 = <<43+7=50>>50.\n#### 50"

        "answer": "The hole is 6 feet long by 4 feet wide by 3 feet deep or 6 * 4 * 3 = <<6*4*3=72>>72 cubic feet.\nBob shovels a cubic foot of earth every 3 seconds so it will take 72 * 3 = <<72*3=216>>216 seconds to dig the hole.\n#### 216"

        "answer": "At the first stop 172 people - 47 people = <<172-47=125>>125 people are on the train.\nThen 13 more people get on increasing it to 125 people + 13 people = <<13+125=138>>138 people.\nAt the next stop 138 people - 38 people = <<138-38=100>>100 people remain on the train.\n#### 100"

        "answer": "Since each country has 5 cities, then in all the 26 countries, there are 26*5 = <<26*5=130>>130 cities.\nIf each city has 1000 people, then the 130 cities have 130*1000 = 130000\n#### 130000"
