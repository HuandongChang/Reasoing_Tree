What is the total amount of money Marcel earned from selling bicycles during that month?", "answer": "First, let's calculate the price of the BMX bike which is half of the price of one MTB, so it's 500 * 0.5 = $<<500*0.5=250>>250.\nHalf of the sold bikes were Trekking bikes, which means 300 * 0.5 = <<300*0.5=150>>150 bikes.\n15% of the sold bikes were BMX bikes, which means 300 * 15/100 = <<300*15/100=45>>45 bikes.\nThe remaining bicycles sold were of the MTB type and there were 300 - 150 - 45 = <<300-150-45=105>>105 bikes of this type sold.\nThat means Marcel earned 150 * 450 = $<<150*450=67500>>67500 from Trekking bikes.\nHe also earned 45 * 250 = $<<45*250=11250>>11250 from BMX bikes.\nMTB bikes got him 105 * 500 = $<<105*500=52500>>52500\nIn total Marcel earned 67500 + 11250 + 52500 = $<<67500+11250+52500=131250>>131250 during that month.\n#### 131250", "id": 1086}, {"question": "???", "answer": "The farmer makes 5*6= <<5*6=30>>30 bales of hay.\nThe truck takes away 3*6= <<3*6=18>>18 bales of hay.\nThere are 30-18= <<30-18=12>>12 bales of hay left in the field.\n#### 12", "id": 1087}, {"question": "???", "answer": "He takes 6+2=<<6+2=8>>8 classes a day\nThat means he spends 40*8=<<40*8=320>>320 minutes per day in class\nSo he spends 320*5=<<320*5=1600>>1600 minutes a week\nThat means he spends 1600/16=<<1600/16=100>>100 minutes each on Saturday and Sunday\nSo he spends 1600+100+100=<<1600+100+100=1800>>1800 minutes per week\nSo he spends 1800/60=<<1800/60=30>>30 hours per week\n#### 30", "id": 1088}, {"question": "Nathan has a bouncy ball that bounces to 2/3rds of its starting height with each bounce.
