If 82 snakes and 19 alligators were hiding How many alligators were not hiding?", "groud_truth_answer": "56.0", "model_response": " Let's think step by step. Originally, there were 3 snakes and 75 alligators. The number of snakes then became 82. The difference between the new number of snakes and the original number of snakes is 82 - 3 = 79. The number of alligators is now 75 + 19 = 94. Since we know there are 75 alligators originally, the number of alligators not hiding is 94 - 75 = 19.
