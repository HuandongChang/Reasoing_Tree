How many more kids did she play with on monday than on tuesday?", "groud_truth_answer": "1.0", "model_response": " Let's think step by step. Julia played tag with 19 kids on monday and 18 kids on tuesday. So she played tag with 19 - 18 = 1 kid more on monday. Each hour of playing tag takes one hour. 38 hours is how many kids she played tag with on both days. So 38 kids is 19 kids (from monday) + 18 kids (from tuesday). Subtracting the number of kids she played tag with on monday, we find 38 kids - 19 kids = 19 kids. But we already know that she played tag with 19 kids on monday, so this problem does not make sense.

Since Frank can't read a fraction of a page, we round down to 26 pages per chapter. Frank read 26 pages per chapter and read the entire book in 6 days, so he read 26 pages/chapter * 24 chapters = 624 pages.

If he scored the same number of points in each round, then 84 points is 2 rounds x points per round. We solve for points per round by dividing both sides of the equation by 2. 84 / 2 = 42. But that is more than Luke scored, so we need to divide by 2 again. 42 / 2 = 21. That's not right either, so we need to divide by 2 one more time. 21 / 2 = 10.5.
